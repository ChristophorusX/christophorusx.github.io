        <h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
<p>Consider the opportunity to invest in a project. The payoff process <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of the underlying project follows a geometric Brownian motion, <span class="math display">\[
{dX_t\over X_t}=bdt+\sigma dW_t
\]</span></p>
<p>Investment in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be made at any time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> at cost <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, which is know and fixed. The performance functional of the agent, whose time preferences are described by a weighted discount function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, which is obtained from some weighting distribution <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, is given by <span class="math display">\[
J(x;u)=\mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^\infty e^{-r\tau_u}dF(r)(X_{\tau_u}-I)\right]
\]</span></p>
<p>The simple net present value rule is to invest as long as <span class="math inline">\(V&gt;I\)</span>, but as McDonald and Siegel demonstrated, this is incorrect. Because future values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are unknown, there is an opportunity cost to investing today.</p>
<h4 id="bellman-equations">Bellman Equations</h4>
<p>The Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is a partial differential equation which is central to optimal control theory. The solution of the HJB equation is the value function which gives the minimum cost for a given dynamical system with an associated cost function. The equation is a result of the theory of dynamic programming which was pioneered in the 1950s by Richard Bellman and coworkers. The corresponding discrete-time equation is usually referred to as the Bellman equation.</p>
<p>To understand the Bellman equation, several underlying concepts must be understood. First, any optimization problem has some objective: minimizing travel time, minimizing cost, maximizing profits, maximizing utility, et cetera. The mathematical function that describes this objective is called the objective function.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming breaks a multi-period planning problem into simpler steps at different points in time. Therefore, it requires keeping track of how the decision situation is evolving over time. The information about the current situation which is needed to make a correct decision is called the “state”. For example, to decide how much to consume and spend at each point in time, people would need to know (among other things) their initial wealth. Therefore, wealth <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> would be one of their state variables, but there would probably be others.</p>
<p>The variables chosen at any given point in time are often called the control variables. For example, given their current wealth, people might decide how much to consume now. Choosing the control variables now may be equivalent to choosing the next state; more generally, the next state is affected by other factors in addition to the current control. For example, in the simplest case, today’s wealth (the state) and consumption (the control) might exactly determine tomorrow’s wealth (the new state), though typically other factors will affect tomorrow’s wealth too.</p>
<p>The dynamic programming approach describes the optimal plan by finding a rule that tells what the controls should be, given any possible value of the state. For example, if consumption <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> depends only on wealth <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, we would seek a rule <span class="math inline">\(c(W)\)</span> that gives consumption as a function of wealth. Such a rule, determining the controls as a function of the states, is called a policy function.</p>
<p>Finally, by definition, the optimal decision rule is the one that achieves the best possible value of the objective. For example, if someone chooses consumption, given wealth, in order to maximize happiness (assuming happiness <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> can be represented by a mathematical function, such as a utility function), then each level of wealth will be associated with some highest possible level of happiness, <span class="math inline">\(H(W)\)</span>. The best possible value of the objective, written as a function of the state, is called the value function.</p>
<p>Richard Bellman showed that a dynamic optimization problem in discrete time can be stated in a recursive, step-by-step form known as backward induction by writing down the relationship between the value function in one period and the value function in the next period. The relationship between these two value functions is called the “Bellman equation”. In this approach, the optimal policy in the last time period is specified in advance as a function of the state variable’s value at that time, and the resulting optimal value of the objective function is thus expressed in terms of that value of the state variable. Next, the next-to-last period’s optimization involves maximizing the sum of that period’s period-specific objective function and the optimal value of the future objective function, giving that period’s optimal policy contingent upon the value of the state variable as of the next-to-last period decision. This logic continues recursively back in time, until the first period decision rule is derived, as a function of the initial state variable value, by optimizing the sum of the first-period-specific objective function and the value of the second period’s value function, which gives the value for all the future periods. Thus, each period’s decision is made by explicitly acknowledging that all future decisions will be optimally made.</p>
<h4 id="deriving-the-bellman-equation-in-discrete-setup">Deriving the Bellman Equation in discrete setup</h4>
<p>Let the state at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>. For a decision that begins at time <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, we take as given the initial state <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. Then let <span class="math inline">\(a_t\in \Gamma(x_t)\)</span> be one or more control variables depends on the current state <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>. We also assume that the state chages from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to a new state <span class="math inline">\(T(x,a)\)</span> when action <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is taken, and that the current payoff from taking action <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in state <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(F(x,a)\)</span>. Finally, we have a discount factor <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\beta&lt;1\)</span>. Under this assumption, we have <span class="math display">\[
V(x_0)=\max_{a_t}\sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^t F(x_t,a_t)
\]</span> subject to constraints <span class="math inline">\(a_t\in\Gamma(x_t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_{t+1}=T(x_t,a_t)\)</span>. Then the value function <span class="math inline">\(V(x)\)</span> is the optimal value that can be obtained by maximizing this objective function subject to the assumed constraints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Principle of Optimality:</strong> An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we have the Bellman equation as follows <span class="math display">\[
V(x)=\max_{a\in\Gamma(x)}\lbrace F(x,a)+\beta V(T(x,a))\rbrace
\]</span></p>
<h4 id="basic-model">Basic Model</h4>
The starting point is a model first developed by McDonald and Siegel (1986). They considered the following problem: At what point is it optimal to pay a sunk cost <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in return for a project whose value is <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, given that <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> evolves according to the following geometric Brownian motion:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\label{eq:geometric}
dV=\alpha Vdt+\sigma Vdz \tag
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(dz\)</span> is the increment of a Wiener process.</p>
<p>Note that the firm’s investment opportunity is equivalent to a perpetual call option–the right but not the obligation to buy a share of stock at a pre-specified price. Therefore the decision to invest is equivalent to decide when to exercise such an option. Thus, the investment decision can be viewed as a problem of option valuation. Also, it can be viewed as a problem in dynamic programming.</p>
<p>In this model, we will denote the value of the investment opportunity by <span class="math inline">\(F(V)\)</span>. We want a rule that maximizes this value. Since the payoff from investing at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(V_t-I\)</span>, we want to maximize its expected present value: <span class="math display">\[
F(V)=\max\mathbb{E}[(V_T-I)e^{-\rho T}]
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the unknown future time that the investment is made, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a discount rate.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For this problem to make sense, we must also assume that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&lt;\rho\)</span>; otherwise the integral in  could be made indefinitely larger by choosing a larger <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Thus waiting longer would always be a better policy, and the optimum would not exist. Let <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> denote the difference <span class="math inline">\(\rho-\alpha\)</span>, which is greater than <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="investment-behavior-under-weighted-discounting">Investment Behavior Under Weighted Discounting</h4>
<p>We solve the Bellman system explicitly when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> follows a geometric Brownian Motion and when <span class="math inline">\(G(X)=x-I\)</span> for arbitrary weighted discount functions.</p>
